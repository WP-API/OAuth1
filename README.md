# [WP REST API - OAuth 1.0a Server](http://oauth1.wp-api.org/)

Connect applications to your WordPress site without ever giving away your password.

This plugin uses the OAuth 1.0a protocol to allow delegated authorization; that is, to allow applications to access a site using a set of secondary credentials. This allows server administrators to control which applications can access the site, as well as allowing users to control which applications have access to their data.

## New to OAuth

We strongly recommend you use an existing OAuth library. You'll be best off if you understand the authorization process, but leave the actual implementation to well-tested libraries, as there are a lot of edge cases.

Start reading from [the Introduction](docs/introduction/README.md) to get started!

## For OAuth Veterans

If you already know how to use OAuth, here's the lowdown:

* The plugin uses **OAuth 1.0a** in
* We use the **three-legged flow**
* To find the REST API index, apply the [API autodiscovery process](http://v2.wp-api.org/guide/discovery/)
* The endpoints for the OAuth process are available in the REST API index: check for `$.authentication.oauth1` in the index data.
    * The **temporary credentials** (request token) endpoint is `$.authentication.oauth1.request` (typically `/oauth1/request`)
    * The **authorization** endpoint is `$.authentication.oauth1.authorize` (typically `/oauth1/authorize`)
    * The **token exchange** (access token) endpoint is `$.authentication.oauth1.access` (typically `/oauth1/access`)
* Your callback URL must match the registered callback URL for the application in the scheme, authority (user/password) host, port, and path sections. (**Subpaths are not allowed.**)
* The only signature method supported is **HMAC-SHA1**.
* OAuth parameters are supported in the Authorization header, query (GET) parameters, or request body (POST) parameters (if encoded as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`). **OAuth parameters are not supported in JSON data.**

== Description ==
Connect applications to your WordPress site without ever giving away your password.

This plugin uses the OAuth 1.0a protocol to allow delegated authorization; that is, to allow applications to access a site using a set of secondary credentials. This allows server administrators to control which applications can access the site, as well as allowing users to control which applications have access to their data.

This plugin only supports WordPress >= 4.4.
